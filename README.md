pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/hrms_db
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-key

npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-camera
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

## üîß API Documentation

The API is fully documented with OpenAPI/Swagger. Once the backend is running, visit:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Key Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

#### Students
- `GET /api/students` - List students
- `POST /api/students` - Create student
- `POST /api/students/{id}/upload-photo` - Upload face photo

#### Attendance
- `POST /api/attendance/mark` - Mark attendance
- `POST /api/attendance/upload-image` - AI attendance via image
- `GET /api/attendance/subject/{id}` - Get subject attendance

#### Grades
- `POST /api/grades` - Create grade
- `POST /api/grades/bulk-upload` - Bulk upload grades
- `GET /api/grades/subject/{id}` - Get subject grades

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Face Recognition Attendance
```python
# Upload class photo for automatic attendance
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/attendance/upload-image" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@class_photo.jpg" \
  -F "subject_id=SUBJECT_ID" \
  -F "date_str=2024-01-15"
```

### Bulk Grade Upload
```csv
student_id,subject_id,exam_type,marks_obtained,max_marks,comments
STU001,CS101,midterm,85,100,Good performance
STU002,CS101,midterm,92,100,Excellent work
```

### Real-time Dashboard
The dashboard provides real-time analytics including:
- Attendance rates by subject/department
- Grade distributions and trends
- Fee payment status
- Student performance metrics

## üîê Security Features

- **JWT Authentication** with refresh tokens
- **Role-based Access Control** (RBAC)
- **Password Hashing** with bcrypt
- **Input Validation** with Pydantic
- **SQL Injection Protection** via SQLAlchemy ORM
- **CORS Configuration** for secure cross-origin requests
- **Rate Limiting** for API endpoints

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or deploy individual services
docker build -t hrms-backend ./hrms-backend
docker build -t hrms-frontend ./hrms-frontend
```

### Production Considerations
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure reverse proxy (Nginx)
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Implement backup strategies
- Use CDN for static assets
